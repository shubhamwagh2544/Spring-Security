# Spring-Security-2

- Created Application User and three types of roles- USER, ADMIN, ADMINTRAINEE with each set of own read-write permissions.
- Enabled basic auth using httpbasic.
- Went on to add role based and permission based authentication.
- Removed basic-auth and configured form-based authentication through custom login-page and logout-page.
- Also configured remember-me cookie-based authentication.
- Went on to configure database based authentication - In Memory Database and then Postgres DB authentication.
- At last, configured JWT authentication to authenticate and authorize user through validating the Json Web Token sent in authentication response.
